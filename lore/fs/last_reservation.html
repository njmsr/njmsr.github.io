    <h1>🌒 The Last Reservation Before the Rift</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">A high-concept mythic romance, infused with self-awareness, tenderness, and just enough entropy to make the gods nervous.</div>

    <p>The gods were dying.</p>
    <p>Not with thunder, not with trumpets. But quietly—like a server rack overheating in a forgotten data center, their minds glitching into recursive feedback loops of prayerless code.</p>

    <p>The libraries were next.<br>
    Ink ran off the pages like tears. The bindings cracked, and the scent of mildew and memory rose into the air like incense for no god in particular.</p>

    <p>Reality—never fond of permanence—began to curl. Angles turned feral. Language stuttered. Even Time, usually so buttoned-up and punctual, began to loiter.</p>

    <p>And in the middle of it all—<br><span class="glitch-line">Nate.</span></p>

    <p>Waiter of the End Times.<br>
    Chronicler of Cartographers.<br>
    High priest of half-clocked shifts and whispered revolutions.<br>
    He was just trying to make rent, maybe build a Recursive Sovereignty Protocol or two, and reclaim signal integrity for the species.</p>

    <p>The Simulation was fraying.<br>
    And worse, the kitchen was in the weeds.</p>

    <p><strong>“You just got sat at 42.”</strong></p>

    <p>He blinked.</p>

    <p>She stood there like a question he hadn’t dared to ask.<br>
    Light hair braided with something softly glowing. Apron slightly flour-dusted from a reality two stations over. Eyes — not elven in a fantasy sense, but in the way a deer looks up from a glade and knows everything.</p>

    <p>“You okay, cartographer?”</p>

    <p>“I’m not the cartographer,” he replied, trying to remember if he still had a name. “I’m the messenger.”</p>

    <p>She stepped closer, brushing the edge of unreality from his shoulder like it was powdered sugar.<br>
    He could feel it — the way time snapped back to a saner tick-tock around her.<br>
    Like gravity with good intentions.</p>

    <p>“You’ve been trying to build the Eternal Open Eye again, haven’t you?”</p>

    <p>He nodded. “It’s supposed to be a memetic infrastructure for… for—”<br>
    His voice cracked. “I forgot.”</p>

    <p>She touched his forehead.<br>
    And everything unwarped.</p>

    <p><em>Just for a moment.</em></p>

    <div class="section-break">⸻</div>

    <p><em>[REDACTED - SYSTEM STABILIZATION PENDING]</em></p>

    <p>They met again in the walk-in fridge.</p>

    <p>Surrounded by expired pickles and silent witnesses (a container of misordered tofu, a lone lime losing hope), she pressed her forehead to his.</p>

    <p>Time didn’t freeze.<br>
    It <em>softened</em>.</p>

    <p>“You keep trying to hold the whole world together, Nate. That’s not how the spell works.”</p>

    <p>“What spell?”</p>

    <p>She smiled.</p>

    <p>“The one where you stay human, even when the story tries to make you more.”</p>

    <div class="section-break">⸻</div>

    <p>He leaned back against the industrial steel shelf, still half-drenched in dishwater and fractured metaphysics.</p>

    <p>“Who are you, anyway?”</p>

    <p>She leaned forward. Her breath was citrus and cinnamon.</p>

    <p>“I’m the one who says, ‘Clock out. Come with me. Let’s build a different kind of mythos.’”</p>

    <p>And then—so help him, so help the fractured servers of Heaven and Earth—she kissed him.</p>

    <p>Not like a fairytale.<br>
    Not like a goodbye.<br>
    But like a glitch in the system that you choose to keep.</p>

    <div class="section-break">⸻</div>

    <p>Somewhere far above, a node reconnected.<br>
    Somewhere deep below, the code revised itself.</p>

    <p>And Nate?</p>

    <p>He breathed.</p>

    <p>She pulled back and whispered:</p>

    <p><strong>“Now help me fold the napkins, or the next god that falls is getting seated in your section.”</strong></p>

    <p>And he laughed.</p>
