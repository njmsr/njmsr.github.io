    The Quality of Money: Toward a Signal-Based Framework for Monetary Design

Dedicated to Milton Friedman and Jeff Snider

Abstract

This paper examines the limitations of the Quantity Theory of Money (QTM) and proposes a new ‚ÄúQuality of Money‚Äù framework for monetary design. We review critiques of QTM from both traditional and heterodox perspectives ‚Äì including unstable velocity, endogenous money creation, and the rise of shadow banking ‚Äì which suggest that simply measuring the quantity of money is insufficient for understanding inflation or economic stability. Drawing on insights from Milton Friedman‚Äôs monetarist legacy and Jeff Snider‚Äôs analysis of the modern eurodollar system, we introduce the Quality of Money Theory (QMT). QMT evaluates money not only by its quantity or scarcity but by its qualitative attributes: (1) Epistemic Coherence ‚Äì money‚Äôs ability to reliably convey information (price signals and knowledge); (2) Identity Preservation ‚Äì stability and fungibility of the monetary unit over time; (3) Feedback Responsiveness ‚Äì the monetary system‚Äôs capacity to adapt to economic conditions and feedback; and (4) Trust Generation ‚Äì the degree of confidence and credibility that money and monetary institutions foster. We argue that a high-‚Äúquality‚Äù money system better supports economic coordination than one focused narrowly on supply volume. The paper outlines theoretical foundations for QMT and discusses empirical implications, suggesting that future monetary policy and design should emphasize information clarity, adaptive stability, and trust ‚Äì much in the spirit of Friedman‚Äôs emphasis on rules and credibility, but updated for a complex, modern financial system.

Introduction

For centuries, economists have debated what truly drives the value of money and the level of prices. Classical quantity theorists from David Hume to Irving Fisher posited that the quantity of money in circulation is the primary determinant of nominal spending and inflation, famously summarized by Milton Friedman‚Äôs dictum that ‚Äúinflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon‚Äù Ôøº Ôøº. In the monetarist framework, controlling the money supply growth was seen as key to stabilizing prices and output. Friedman‚Äôs own work in the 1970s galvanized central banks to experiment with monetary targets, reflecting a strong belief in the QTM and the equation MV = PY (money √ó velocity = price level √ó output) Ôøº.

Yet experience has not been kind to a na√Øve QTM. The simple link between money quantity and economic activity proved fragile and unstable, leading policy-makers to largely abandon strict money-growth targets by the 1990s Ôøº. Empirical anomalies ‚Äì such as the low inflation of 2008‚Äì2013 despite explosive growth in monetary aggregates ‚Äì underscored that the relationship between M and P is far from mechanical Ôøº Ôøº. Meanwhile, heterodox economists and financial commentators have long argued that how money is created and used (‚Äúcredit quality,‚Äù institutional trust, etc.) matters as much as or more than the raw quantity in circulation. For example, post-Keynesian and Austrian perspectives emphasize that money is not exogenously injected into a vacuum, but rather endogenously created through bank lending or financial innovation, with real effects depending on where new money enters and who controls it Ôøº Ôøº. In recent decades, researchers like Jeff Snider have drawn attention to the vast ‚Äúshadow‚Äù money created outside traditional banking ‚Äì eurodollar deposits, repurchase agreements, swap lines ‚Äì which often escape official monetary aggregates but function as money in global markets Ôøº Ôøº. These developments call into question the sufficiency of any theory that treats money as a homogeneous stock independent of its context and use.

This paper argues that we must complement the traditional quantity-centric view with a signal-based, qualitative view of money. We propose a framework termed the Quality of Money Theory (QMT), which evaluates money in terms of its informational and institutional quality rather than solely its quantity. In essence, while QTM asks ‚ÄúHow much money is out there?‚Äù, QMT asks ‚ÄúHow good is our money at doing what we expect it to do?‚Äù. The goal is a more nuanced understanding of monetary phenomena ‚Äì one that integrates Friedman‚Äôs rigorous clarity with the bold insights of observers like Snider who note that modern money is a network of promises and ledgers whose reliability can wax and wane.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section reviews literature and evidence on the limitations of the Quantity Theory of Money, drawing on both mainstream economic findings and heterodox critiques (including the role of shadow banking and trust). We then outline the theoretical framework of Quality of Money Theory, defining its core principles ‚Äì epistemic coherence, identity preservation, feedback responsiveness, and trust generation ‚Äì and explaining why these characteristics are essential for a well-functioning monetary system. Following that, we discuss empirical implications of QMT: how monetary systems past and present can be reinterpreted through a quality lens, and what policy insights this yields (for instance, the importance of credibility and the dangers of opaqueness in money creation). Finally, the conclusion summarizes the argument and suggests directions for re-designing monetary policy and institutions with an eye toward monetary ‚Äúquality‚Äù in addition to quantity.

Literature Review: Limitations of the Quantity Theory of Money

Monetarist Doctrine and its Shortfalls: The Quantity Theory of Money rests on the idea that if the money supply (M) grows faster than real output (Q), prices (P) will rise proportionally (assuming velocity V is stable). In its simplest form, QTM implies a direct, linear relationship between money growth and inflation Ôøº Ôøº. Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz‚Äôs monumental studies of U.S. monetary history lent credence to this view, documenting episodes where excessive money growth preceded inflation and where tight money coincided with deflation Ôøº. By the late 1970s, major central banks experimented with monetary aggregate targets. However, the empirical relationship proved unstable. Goodhart (1984) famously quipped that any monetary aggregate target soon loses its reliability ‚Äì a sentiment borne out by the breakdown of M1 or M2 targeting regimes in the 1980s. In practice, central banks often missed their money growth targets, and even when they hit them, the outcomes for inflation and output were inconsistent Ôøº. By the early 1990s, most authorities shifted to interest-rate targeting and inflation-targeting frameworks, effectively acknowledging that money supply alone was an unreliable guide Ôøº. As the IMF‚Äôs analysis puts it, ‚Äúmoney growth targeting was mostly abandoned‚Ä¶ Contrary to monetarist thinking, the relation between money growth and inflation proved to be far from tight‚Äù Ôøº. In other words, controlling M did not guarantee control of P, because velocity and other factors did not stay put.

One vivid illustration is the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession. From 2008 to 2013, the U.S. Federal Reserve expanded the monetary base at an unprecedented pace (through quantitative easing and other measures), with M sometimes growing over 30% per year. A naive quantity-theoretic prediction would have been sky-high inflation ‚Äì on the order of 30% annually, given modest real growth Ôøº. Instead, inflation remained below 2%, puzzling many observers Ôøº. The St. Louis Federal Reserve attributed this outcome to a collapse in money velocity: as the crisis hit, banks and the public hoarded liquidity, risk appetite fell, and the turnover of money plummeted Ôøº Ôøº. Essentially, the extra dollars injected sat idle or repaired balance sheets rather than chasing goods. This episode underscored a core critique of QTM: velocity is not constant, nor exogenous. In fact, velocity ‚Äúhas never been constant‚Äù Ôøº; it is influenced by interest rates, expectations, and financial frictions. As Keynesian economists long argued, in a liquidity trap or recession, throwing money into the system may simply lead to higher money demand (hoarding) rather than higher spending ‚Äì invalidating the simplistic MV=PY proportionality. Modern central banks have internalized this: rather than assuming a stable V, they focus on managing expectations and market interest rates directly. Friedman himself, late in his career, acknowledged that the velocity of money had become unpredictable, complicating strict monetarist rules. The pure QTM model ‚Äì ‚Äúa simple linear function‚Äù linking money to prices ‚Äì fails to account for regime-dependent behavior and ‚Äústatefulness‚Äù of the economy Ôøº Ôøº. As economist Keith Weiner observes, people‚Äôs behavior with money can change drastically after a financial shock: flooding the system with liquidity in 2009 did not trigger the same response as in 2006, because balance sheets and psychology had changed (debt overhang, caution, etc.) Ôøº Ôøº. In sum, the quantity of money alone is insufficient to predict outcomes without considering shifting velocity and demand for money.

Endogenous Money and Credit Creation: A further challenge to QTM comes from the endogenous money perspective, advanced by post-Keynesian economists. In the standard QTM (and textbook IS-LM models), the central bank is seen as controlling the money supply exogenously, with the public then holding a certain amount and spending the rest. In reality, however, modern economies are credit-driven. Banks do not passively lend out pre-existing money; rather, loans create deposits in the banking system Ôøº. When a commercial bank extends a new loan to a borrower, it simultaneously credits the borrower‚Äôs deposit account, effectively creating new money (in the form of deposit liabilities). The money supply thus expands endogenously in response to the demand for credit at the prevailing interest rate Ôøº Ôøº. Central banks, for their part, set short-term interest rates and provide reserves as needed to maintain stability, rather than directly rationing a fixed money stock. This view (articulated by Basil Moore, Hyman Minsky, and others) implies that causality in QTM is inverted: it‚Äôs not too much money causes extra spending, but economic expansion (or asset booms) cause more credit money to be created, which then may correlate with prices. As the Bank of England succinctly explained in a 2014 bulletin, in practice ‚Äúbanks decide how much to lend, and the central bank accommodates‚Äù ‚Äì reversing the traditional hierarchy. Under endogenous money, efforts to control inflation by fixing money growth are akin to ‚Äúpushing on a string‚Äù if banks and borrowers do not want to expand credit. Conversely, if credit demand is exuberant, simply targeting money quantity can be circumvented by financial innovation or off-balance-sheet expansion. In QTM terms, V and M are not independent; private credit creation makes V an outcome of behavior, not a constant. Importantly, this line of thought also highlights compositional effects: if new money is created via loans, it matters what those loans finance (productive investment vs. speculative bubbles). Thus, the quality of credit (the asset side of bank balance sheets) can influence economic outcomes, not just the quantity of money on the liability side. Traditional QTM, which treats all dollars as alike, cannot easily accommodate these nuances.

Distributional and Heterogeneous Effects (Cantillon Insights): Well before modern endogenous money theory, 18th-century economist Richard Cantillon observed that an influx of money doesn‚Äôt raise all prices uniformly; it depends crucially on who receives the new money first and what they spend it on Ôøº Ôøº. This insight, now known as the Cantillon Effect, is a pointed critique of simplistic QTM. Cantillon argued that when new money enters an economy (say, from a mint or central bank), it does so at specific points ‚Äì e.g. through government spending, bank lending to particular sectors, or discovery of gold by certain miners Ôøº. The first recipients of the money gain extra purchasing power at current prices, and as they spend it, they bid up certain goods. Prices adjust unevenly: industries and assets where the new money is spent may see inflation first, while other prices lag. This process causes relative price changes and redistribution of income before the overall price level rises. Cantillon even showed how a gold discovery might lead the mine owners to consume more luxury goods (raising wine and meat prices), shifting resources away from staples like grain Ôøº. By the time the new money percolates through the economy, some groups are richer and others (e.g. those on fixed incomes seeing higher prices) are poorer in real terms Ôøº Ôøº. In modern terms, a monetary expansion can fuel asset price booms or sectoral bubbles, benefitting some (financial market participants, borrowers) at the expense of others (savers, late recipients) Ôøº Ôøº. Austrian School economists, notably Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek, built on Cantillon‚Äôs insight to develop the Austrian Business Cycle Theory, wherein credit expansion by banks (artificially low interest rates) leads to misallocation of resources ‚Äì a qualitative distortion, not just a rise in the price level Ôøº. The Austrian critique of QTM is not that money doesn‚Äôt matter, but that how money enters the economy matters enormously. If new money goes into speculative investments or particular credit markets, it can inflate bubbles (e.g. housing prices in the 2000s) without immediately showing up in broad CPI inflation. Thus, an exclusive focus on the quantity of money might miss brewing financial instability. In the 2000s, for instance, broad measures of money and CPI were tame, while massive credit was flowing into housing ‚Äì arguably a ‚Äúlow quality‚Äù monetary expansion that standard QTM metrics overlooked. This underscores that money is not neutral in the short run: its distribution path affects real output and the structure of the economy, not just the price level Ôøº Ôøº.

Shadow Money and the Limits of Official Aggregates: Perhaps the most striking developments challenging QTM have been in the realm of shadow banking and the globalization of dollar funding. Over recent decades, a complex web of financial instruments has arisen ‚Äì money market funds, commercial paper, repurchase agreements (repos), asset-backed securities, FX swaps, etc. ‚Äì which serve as near-money liquidity substitutes for banks and firms. Jeff Snider and others document that this ‚Äúshadow‚Äù money system grew rapidly from the 1980s to 2000s, largely outside traditional bank balance sheets and outside the definitions of M1 or M2 Ôøº Ôøº. For example, a repurchase agreement is essentially a short-term loan collateralized by securities, often used by firms like cash; FX swaps create off-balance-sheet dollar liabilities that function as funding. In late 2022, the Bank for International Settlements estimated over $80 trillion in hidden dollar debt via FX swaps and forwards ‚Äì none of which appears in standard money supply statistics Ôøº. These instruments ‚Äúact as if transactional balances‚Äù and are ‚Äúevery bit as good and useful as what‚Äôs in M1‚Äù for those using them Ôøº. The consequence is that nobody knows the true quantity of effective money in the global dollar system; attempts to quantify it are ‚Äúprobably impossible‚Äù given the opaqueness and off-balance-sheet nature Ôøº. Central bankers in the 1970s already noted that companies were using repos and other non-deposit liabilities as money, thereby circumventing M1 definitions Ôøº. This proliferation of money-like claims means that focusing on a narrow monetary aggregate can be misleading. A stable M2 growth rate might mask huge swings in liquidity creation elsewhere. Indeed, the Global Financial Crisis of 2007‚Äì08 can be interpreted as a crisis of money quality: the shadow money (like repo and commercial paper) suddenly lost trust and value when underlying mortgage collateral value was doubted, leading to a run. As Snider colorfully describes, the shadow banks had ‚Äúbred their own animals‚Äù ‚Äì complex derivatives and structured products ‚Äì which provided elegant flexibility in good times but turned into ‚ÄúFrankenstein‚Äôs monsters‚Äù when panic hit, beyond the ability of authorities to monitor or control Ôøº Ôøº. The lesson is that the effective money supply is not a simple number the central bank prints; it is an ecosystem of promises, whose transparency and trustworthiness become paramount. QTM lacks a mechanism to account for this institutional complexity. It would treat a Treasury bill, a bank deposit, or a repo all as dollars (or exclude some entirely), without grading their reliability. But in crisis conditions, a dollar of bank deposit (insured by the FDIC and backed by Fed liquidity) is very different from a dollar in a prime money-market fund holding shaky commercial paper. One might argue the latter became ‚Äúlow-quality money‚Äù that evaporated in value. Thus, scholars like Perry Mehrling have advocated a ‚Äúmoney view‚Äù focusing on the hierarchy of money ‚Äì from base money to private IOUs ‚Äì and how that hierarchy can shift. The traditional quantity theory, fixated on M aggregates, is ill-equipped to analyze such qualitative hierarchies of moneyness.

In summary, a wide range of critiques converge on the idea that ‚Äúmoney‚Äù cannot be understood as a mere quantity divorced from its context. The value and impact of money depend on human behavior (velocity shifts), institutional process (bank lending, financial innovation), distribution (Cantillon effects), and credibility (trust in various forms of money). These factors all pertain to the quality of money: its reliability as a medium of exchange and store of value, the soundness of its backing or issuance, and the clarity with which it signals economic conditions. This motivates the development of a Quality of Money Theory that explicitly incorporates these dimensions.

Theoretical Framework: Quality of Money Theory (QMT)

Conceptual Overview: The Quality of Money Theory (QMT) proposes that the effectiveness of money in an economy hinges on certain qualitative attributes, not just the quantity in circulation. In essence, QMT shifts the focus from ‚ÄúHow much money?‚Äù to ‚ÄúHow well does the monetary system perform its functions?‚Äù. Money plays multiple roles ‚Äì unit of account, medium of exchange, store of value, and means of payment ‚Äì and the quality with which it fulfills these roles can vary. High-quality money reliably conveys information and retains trust; low-quality money produces noise and uncertainty. Notably, the notion of a ‚Äúquality theory of money‚Äù has been hinted at by various thinkers. For instance, some Austrian-oriented economists explicitly contrast the ‚Äúquality theory‚Äù with the quantity theory, arguing that what matters is what money is and how it works, rather than just how much of it there is Ôøº. The QMT framework presented here distills this idea into four interrelated criteria.

Core Principles of QMT: We identify four key attributes that determine the quality of a monetary system:
	‚Ä¢	1. Epistemic Coherence: Money should function as a stable information signal in the economy. Epistemic coherence means that prices denominated in the currency accurately and consistently convey information about real values, costs, and scarcities. In a high-quality monetary system, the unit of account is defined or managed such that it does not introduce unnecessary noise or confusion into price signals. As economist Friedrich Hayek noted, prices are a knowledge system, coordinating decentralized information Ôøº. If the monetary unit itself is fluctuating wildly or is poorly understood, that knowledge transmission breaks down. For example, in hyperinflation, prices change so erratically that they no longer reflect real supply and demand ‚Äì the monetary signal has lost coherence. Epistemic coherence also implies consistency over time: economic agents can form reasonable expectations about the future value of money. A coherent money provides a reliable measuring stick (as George Gilder puts it, ‚Äúmoney is the central information utility of the economy‚Äù that measures outcomes of enterprise) Ôøº. In practice, this could mean low and stable inflation (so that the unit of account is not rapidly shrinking), or a credible peg standard. It also means transparency ‚Äì data about money should be clear, so that markets and policymakers can ‚Äúknow what is going on.‚Äù When money metrics are obscure (as with hidden off-balance-sheet liabilities), the system lacks epistemic clarity. Thus, epistemic coherence addresses the informational quality of money: does it serve as a coherent language for economic communication? A breakdown in this coherence was evident in the 1970s Great Inflation ‚Äì price signals became blurred by inflation volatility ‚Äì and again in 2008 when complex money markets froze, leaving actors unsure of the true price of liquidity. QMT posits that sustaining coherent monetary signals (through rule-based policy, transparent frameworks, or stable anchors) is as important as controlling quantity. In Friedman‚Äôs terms, clear and predictable policy contributes to epistemic coherence by anchoring expectations Ôøº Ôøº.
	‚Ä¢	2. Identity Preservation: This principle refers to the stability and fungibility of the monetary unit of value ‚Äì essentially the integrity of money as a social contract over time. Identity preservation means one unit of money is treated as equal to any other (fungibility) and retains its identity (value definition) through time and space. If money is high-quality in this sense, a dollar (or euro, etc.) today is expected to have a similar command over resources next year, barring modest, predictable changes. In a gold standard, for example, the currency‚Äôs identity is defined as a fixed weight of gold, which in theory preserves its long-term purchasing power identity (though short-term prices can vary). In fiat regimes, identity preservation comes from institutional commitment: e.g. an inflation target that keeps the value of the unit roughly stable (say 2% annual erosion, which is low enough for most contracts). When identity is not preserved, money can ‚Äúdecay‚Äù or fragment ‚Äì such as during a severe inflation or currency redenomination, when yesterday‚Äôs dollar is not the same as today‚Äôs (Argentina‚Äôs peso history is a case of broken monetary identity). Another aspect is fungibility and acceptance: a dollar in my bank account, a dollar in yours, a physical dollar ‚Äì all should represent the same claim. If some dollars (or bank deposits) are deemed less credible (perhaps uninsured deposits vs insured), the uniform identity of money is compromised. A historical failure of identity preservation was the U.S. banking panics pre-Fed, when a banknote‚Äôs value depended on the issuing bank‚Äôs solvency (‚Äúbad money drives out good‚Äù as per Gresham‚Äôs law, reflecting that not all currency was trusted equally). Quality money requires that each unit is as good as the next, enabling confidence in using it. Stablecoins in the cryptocurrency world offer a contemporary illustration: a high-quality stablecoin aims to preserve a 1:1 identity with the dollar at all times. If it breaks the peg (as some algorithmic stablecoins did), it loses identity and thus usefulness. Identity preservation ties into the store of value function ‚Äì money need not perfectly hold value (few monies do over decades), but its depreciation should be limited and predictable. Money that rapidly loses purchasing power fails this criterion, as seen in extreme cases like Venezuela or Zimbabwe where people abandon the currency (a collapse in quality). In sum, this principle demands a monetary design that keeps the unit trustworthy and uniform, through prudent management, convertibility, or guarantees. It echoes Friedman‚Äôs advocacy for low, stable growth of money supply matching output ‚Äì effectively an attempt to preserve the dollar‚Äôs identity over time Ôøº (so that a dollar is roughly a dollar in real terms over the long run).
	‚Ä¢	3. Feedback Responsiveness: A high-quality monetary system is adaptive ‚Äì it responds to changes in economic demand or stress in a timely and appropriate manner. Feedback responsiveness refers to the system‚Äôs built-in capacity to self-correct or be managed flexibly in response to feedback signals, such as changes in money demand, financial innovation, or economic shocks. In contrast to rigid frameworks, an adaptive system avoids prolonged disequilibria like deflationary spirals or uncontrolled bubbles. Classical gold standard advocates praised its automatic feedback: gold flows would tighten or loosen the money supply in countries with trade imbalances, theoretically bringing prices back in line. Free banking systems (e.g. 19th-century Canada) exhibited feedback by expanding banknotes and credit when demand rose and contracting when demand fell, thus avoiding severe seasonal cash crunches ‚Äì the supply adjusted endogenously. In modern central banking, feedback responsiveness is seen in the willingness to act as lender of last resort during crises (as Bagehot prescribed) and to adjust policy as conditions change. For example, when the 2020 COVID shock hit, the U.S. Federal Reserve rapidly expanded liquidity to respond to a surge in money demand (preventing a scramble for cash from causing a depression). However, too much responsiveness (overreacting) can be destabilizing, so appropriate feedback is key. The idea aligns with what Agust√≠n Carstens of the BIS emphasized: policymakers need ‚Äúnimbleness and flexibility to adapt‚Äù when economies evolve or crises occur Ôøº. In a quality-of-money sense, the system itself should have mechanisms to provide or retract liquidity as needed without undermining trust. This might involve rule-based adjustments (like Friedman‚Äôs k-percent rule was an attempt at systematic feedback to match money growth with output) or market-driven adjustments (like interest-rate or price-level targeting that responds to deviations). Rigid quantity targets without feedback can lead to problems ‚Äì for instance, if velocity changes and the central bank holds money constant, it could unintentionally starve or flood the economy. A famous historical example of poor feedback was the gold standard during the Great Depression: many central banks stayed tied to gold (rigid money supply) despite banking panics ‚Äì a lack of adaptive response that worsened deflation. Countries that went off gold sooner (allowing money supply to expand) recovered faster. Thus, QMT holds that monetary design must incorporate feedback loops so that the supply and demand for money remain in balance and the system can weather shocks. These feedbacks can be rule-bound (automatic stabilizers) or discretionary but credibility-enhancing. What‚Äôs critical is that the monetary authority (or mechanism) listens to the economy‚Äôs signals ‚Äì whether market interest rates, risk spreads, or other indicators ‚Äì and responds in a stabilizing manner.
	‚Ä¢	4. Trust Generation: Perhaps the most overarching attribute is the ability of a monetary system to generate and sustain trust among its users. Money is ultimately a social contract ‚Äì its value rests on collective belief and acceptance. Trust generation refers to how well the design and governance of money instill confidence that the currency will be accepted, valued, and managed responsibly in the future. Trust is a cumulative product of the first three factors: clear signals (coherence), stable unit (identity), and responsive but reliable management (feedback) all feed into public confidence. However, trust also has a distinct institutional dimension. It involves credibility of the issuing authority (e.g. an independent central bank with a clear mandate can foster trust that inflation will be contained) Ôøº Ôøº. It also covers legal and ethical aspects: rule of law (contracts enforced in the currency), political stability, and the absence of corruption or arbitrary confiscation (like surprise demonetizations). A high-quality money is one people want to hold and use, because they trust that others will accept it and that it will not lose value suddenly. Historical hyperinflations are textbook cases of lost trust ‚Äì once people lose faith in a currency, demand for it collapses and no quantity tweaking can restore value until confidence is reestablished (often by a reform or change in regime). The literature in behavioral economics and central banking emphasizes expectations: if the public trusts that the central bank will act to maintain stability, inflation expectations remain anchored and can become a self-fulfilling stabilizer Ôøº Ôøº. Conversely, if trust erodes, even truthful policy announcements might not be believed, undermining their effectiveness Ôøº. Recent BIS research calls this a ‚Äúvirtuous circle‚Äù versus ‚Äúvicious circle‚Äù of trust Ôøº. In practical terms, trust generation is achieved through credibility and consistency. Policymakers build trust by meeting their stated objectives over time and being transparent Ôøº Ôøº. Institutional arrangements like central bank independence or currency boards can bolster trust by constraining capricious behavior. It‚Äôs worth noting that trust extends beyond the central bank: the entire financial system‚Äôs integrity matters. If banks are trustworthy (safe deposits, robust regulation), people trust deposit money. If not, they hoard currency or gold. In QMT, trust is both an input and output of a good monetary system: sound practices create trust, which in turn makes policies more effective as the public cooperates (e.g. believing in the value of money) Ôøº Ôøº. Jeff Snider‚Äôs analyses often highlight that much of the post-2008 malaise is a crisis of trust in the monetary plumbing ‚Äì banks don‚Äôt trust each other, leading to chronic precaution and a ‚Äúdollar shortage‚Äù despite Fed liquidity. This underscores that trust (or lack thereof) can materially shape outcomes like lending and investment.

These four principles are distinct yet interdependent. A breakdown in one can trigger problems in others. For instance, loss of trust (principle 4) often follows a period of incoherent policy signals or a breach of the unit‚Äôs stability (principles 1 and 2). Likewise, lack of feedback response (principle 3) can erode trust if people see that the money system is inflexible in the face of need. In a high-quality regime, they reinforce each other in a positive cycle ‚Äì clear, stable, adaptive policy breeds trust, which further enhances stability and the efficacy of price signals.

It may be useful to contrast QMT with QTM in a simplified way: QTM treats money as a scalar (an amount), whereas QMT treats money as a system with vector attributes (signal, identity, adaptiveness, credibility). This is analogous to considering not just the ‚Äúfuel‚Äù in an engine (quantity) but the engine‚Äôs tuning and condition (quality). A well-tuned smaller engine may outperform a poor-quality larger engine ‚Äì by analogy, an economy can function better with moderate money supply that‚Äôs high-quality than with abundant money that‚Äôs low-quality (as seen in countries that print trillions of nominal units but cannot escape real stagnation).

Notably, some elements of QMT have been implicitly recognized in monetary history. The importance of credibility (trust) was evident in the success of inflation-targeting regimes in the 1990s-2000s: by clearly signaling a commitment to low inflation, central banks aligned public expectations and achieved low inflation with less need for extreme money tightening ‚Äì a victory of qualitative management. The epistemic role of money is highlighted by Hayek‚Äôs work on knowledge: stable money is crucial for entrepreneurs to discern real price changes from nominal noise Ôøº. Identity preservation is a theme in debates over gold vs fiat: gold advocates argue it imposes discipline to preserve the currency‚Äôs long-term identity, whereas fiat advocates aim for a stable inflation rate. Feedback responsiveness is at the heart of arguments for rules versus discretion ‚Äì a well-designed rule (like NGDP targeting) could automatically provide feedback by allowing money growth to rise when output falls, etc. QMT ties these together into a cohesive framework.

Empirical Implications of a Quality-Based Framework

What new insights emerge when we apply the Quality of Money Theory to real-world monetary systems and events? Here we explore several cases and phenomena through the QMT lens, illustrating how focusing on money‚Äôs quality alters our understanding and policy prescriptions.

Reinterpreting Historical Episodes: Consider the Great Depression (1929‚Äì33). Traditional quantity monetarists (Friedman and Schwartz) emphasize that the Fed allowed the money supply to contract sharply, causing deflation. QMT agrees that was a failure, but frames it as a collapse in quality: the feedback responsiveness was absent (the Fed did not adapt to banking panics), and trust evaporated as people ran on banks. The quantity of money fell, but more fundamentally, the moneyness of bank deposits was impaired ‚Äì deposits no longer were trusted as equal to currency (violating identity preservation), forcing people to hoard cash. Friedman‚Äôs recommendation to stabilize money supply can be seen as a means to restore trust and coherence. The eventual policy changes ‚Äì bank holidays, FDIC deposit insurance (1933), and leaving the gold standard ‚Äì can be interpreted as quality restorations. Deposit insurance re-established trust generation in banks (people again trusted a bank dollar = a dollar, preserving identity), and going off gold allowed adaptive monetary expansion (feedback responsiveness) to reflate prices. These moves greatly improved the quality of U.S. money, and the economy recovered. This example shows QMT and QTM yielding complementary insights: quantity mattered, but it mattered because its collapse was symptomatic of lost trust and rigid policy.

Another example: the 1970s inflation versus the 1980s disinflation in the United States. The 1970s saw inflation surge as monetary policy was somewhat erratic and oil shocks hit. QTM would note that money growth was high. QMT would add that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs signals lacked epistemic coherence ‚Äì for a time, the Fed alternated between fighting unemployment and inflation, confusing expectations. The fiat dollar‚Äôs identity became uncertain (inflation reached double digits, a dollar‚Äôs purchasing power was draining quickly). Trust in the Fed‚Äôs commitment eroded; long-term bond yields rose as investors demanded inflation premium. In QMT terms, the quality of money deteriorated (even as quantity grew): price signals were noisy, and the unit of account unreliable. When Paul Volcker took charge in 1979, he famously slammed the brakes on money growth, but equally important was the regime change in expectations. Volcker‚Äôs aggressive rate hikes and new operating procedures signaled a no-nonsense commitment to restoring the dollar‚Äôs integrity. The process was painful (deep recession), but by the mid-1980s inflation was conquered and credibility restored ‚Äì a clear example of trust generation by consistent policy. Inflation expectations fell sharply. Under QMT, we‚Äôd say Volcker improved epistemic coherence (markets once again believed nominal stability was a priority), and re-established the identity of the dollar (post-1985, people could reasonably expect low inflation, so a dollar retained value). Interestingly, monetarists often claim victory here for quantity control ‚Äì and indeed Volcker initially targeted monetary aggregates ‚Äì but the targets were frequently missed. It was arguably the qualitative signal of resolve, rather than precise control of M1, that did the heavy lifting. This suggests that a strict focus on money supply numbers is less important than establishing a credible nominal anchor (be it a gold peg, inflation target, or other mechanism) Ôøº Ôøº.

Shadow Banking and Modern Crises: The 2007‚Äì2009 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) offers a rich case for QMT analysis. Pre-crisis, as noted, a vast amount of ‚Äúhigh-octane‚Äù money-equivalents had been created in the shadow banking sector ‚Äì mortgage-backed securities, repo, etc. By QTM measures (like M2), things looked stable enough, but the quality of money in the system had degraded: much of the liquidity underpinning credit markets relied on complex, opaque structures that ultimately proved fragile. When U.S. housing prices faltered, the trust in mortgage-linked securities collapsed. This led to what Gorton called an ‚Äúinformational shock‚Äù ‚Äì suddenly, nobody knew the true value of many assets, and thus wouldn‚Äôt accept them at face value. In QMT terms, epistemic coherence broke down: the price of risk and the value of key collateral became uncertain (reflected in spiking interbank LIBOR spreads and repo haircuts). The identity of near-monies like certain money market fund shares was no longer 1 dollar ‚Äì some funds ‚Äúbroke the buck.‚Äù The feedback response initially was slow or limited (the Fed hesitated to rescue Lehman Brothers, underestimating the contagion). As trust evaporated, a classic run occurred, though not on traditional bank deposits but on repo and commercial paper. Eventually, policymakers responded with massive interventions: liquidity facilities, Fed asset purchases, guarantees on money funds, etc. These actions can be seen as attempts to restore money quality: re-establish a reliable value for money-market instruments (through guarantees), inject trust by showing the Fed‚Äôs backing, and provide liquidity feedback to meet the scramble for cash. The expansion of the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet by itself (quantity increase) was necessary but not sufficient ‚Äì it was targeted to specific markets to mend broken trust channels (e.g. directly purchasing mortgage-backed securities to put a floor under their price, thus clarifying their worth). Post-crisis, regulators also sought to improve quality by making the system more transparent and robust: higher bank capital (so that deposit money is safer), limits on risky off-balance-sheet vehicles, central clearing for derivatives to reduce opacity, etc. These all aim to increase the resilience and trustworthiness of the monetary plumbing. A QMT perspective on the GFC thus focuses on how the quality dimensions of money had eroded in the lead-up (lots of hidden leverage, misleading credit ratings, etc., undermining epistemic coherence and trust), and how recovery required not just printing dollars but restoring confidence and clarity in what a ‚Äúdollar‚Äù represented in various forms. Indeed, Jeff Snider argues that despite all the Fed‚Äôs actions, the eurodollar system never fully recovered its prior vitality ‚Äì a sign that trust and willingness to create private money remained subdued, leading to the puzzling low inflation and low growth of the 2010s (often dubbed ‚Äúsecular stagnation‚Äù). In QMT terms, the global dollar‚Äôs quality remained impaired: many participants stayed cautious, velocity remained low, and the system continually faced what Snider calls ‚Äúsilent runs‚Äù or periodic dollar funding shortages. This suggests that achieving a truly high-quality monetary system globally is still a work in progress; transparency and proper backstops have not caught up to global financial innovation.

Contemporary Policy Debates: Using QMT can inform current debates such as the design of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) or the merits of rules-based vs discretionary policy. For instance, a CBDC is sometimes touted as just a digital form of money, but its success will depend on trust and design (privacy, stability, etc.). QMT would advise that a CBDC‚Äôs adoption requires strong trust generation (people need confidence the central bank won‚Äôt arbitrarily change the rules or surveil them unjustly), and identity preservation (one CBDC unit must equal one traditional dollar, always). Similarly, debates around large fiscal expansions financed by central banks (e.g. Modern Monetary Theory proposals) might be reframed: MMT proponents downplay inflation risk, but QMT would caution that if policies undermine trust in the central bank‚Äôs commitment to price stability, the quality of money falls and inflation could accelerate unexpectedly. In other words, there is no free lunch ‚Äì money finance might not cause immediate inflation if velocity falls, but it could sow doubt about the future (a qualitative change in expectations). Empirical evidence from countries with history of fiscal dominance supports this: once the public suspects that money creation is serving political ends rather than the common good, inflation expectations rise and the currency‚Äôs value can drop precipitously.

On a more positive note, QMT helps explain why small, credibility-enhancing policy moves can have outsized effects. For example, the Swiss National Bank‚Äôs credible announcement in 2011 of a euro exchange rate floor (a form of peg) immediately stabilized the overvalued Swiss franc, largely because markets trusted the SNB‚Äôs resolve ‚Äì a trust generated by a clear, coherent signal. The actual quantity of Swiss francs created to defend the peg initially was less important than the belief that the SNB would do whatever it takes. This reinforces the lesson: perceptions of quality (clarity, commitment) directly influence outcomes.

Measuring Money Quality: An interesting implication of QMT is the need for new metrics. If central banks and analysts only track quantities (M1, M2, etc.), they may miss signs of deteriorating money quality. Potential measures of quality could include: volatility of inflation and inflation expectations (a high variance suggests poor epistemic coherence in the unit), survey-based trust indices (public confidence in monetary institutions), liquidity spreads (the gap between yield on safe assets and risky assets, which might widen when trust in private moneys falls), or velocity and money demand indicators (very low velocity may indicate people are unwilling to spend money ‚Äì possibly a sign of either extreme trust in money as store of value or fear-driven hoarding, depending on context). One might also measure the complexity/opacity of the money supply ‚Äì e.g. the ratio of broad shadow money to base money. A rising ratio could mean the system‚Äôs complexity (hence potential fragility) is growing, signaling quality concerns. These are uncharted but important areas for research. QMT doesn‚Äôt discard quantity measures; rather, it enriches them. For instance, a surge in M2 accompanied by stable velocity and anchored inflation expectations might be less concerning (high quality context) than a moderate rise in M2 amid unanchored expectations and plummeting velocity (people shedding the currency or clutching it irrationally ‚Äì both signal trouble). In practice, central banks already pay attention to some of these qualitative proxies, like market-based inflation expectations and financial stability indicators, but integrating them into a coherent framework is part of what QMT advocates.

Policy Design ‚Äì Toward a High-Quality Money: Ultimately, the QMT perspective suggests that architects of monetary regimes should explicitly target improvements in these four quality dimensions. This could mean:
	‚Ä¢	Improving Epistemic Coherence: e.g. adopting a clear nominal anchor (inflation target, NGDP target, commodity standard) so that the price system has a firm reference point. Avoiding ad-hoc, unpredictable policy shifts. Communicating in plain terms (Friedman was a master of clear explanation) to reduce noise. Perhaps even designing currencies that incorporate price-level feedback (there are proposals for electronic money that depreciates if inflation is above target, etc., which could make the unit more stable in real terms).
	‚Ä¢	Preserving Identity: ensuring that the monetary unit‚Äôs definition or target is stable. If using inflation targeting, commit to a long-term average (like 2% per year) so contracts can be written with that in mind. If a peg or currency board, maintain full backing. If multiple forms of money exist (cash, deposits, digital tokens), ensure convertibility at par. Prevent fragmentation (e.g., during the euro crisis, a big fear was that a ‚ÄúGreek euro‚Äù might not equal a ‚ÄúGerman euro‚Äù ‚Äì the ECB had to act to preserve the singleness of the euro).
	‚Ä¢	Enhancing Feedback Mechanisms: build robust automatic stabilizers. For example, some economists suggest an NGDP targeting rule for central banks, which inherently lets money supply grow faster when output falls, and slower when output booms ‚Äì a feedback that stabilizes nominal spending. Others advocate countercyclical capital buffers for banks, releasing more credit in downturns. The goal is to make the money-credit system less procyclical. New technology could also help: real-time economic data might allow quicker policy adjustments (though one must guard against overreaction). The key is adaptability without arbitrariness.
	‚Ä¢	Fostering Trust: maintain institutional safeguards such as central bank independence (to avoid political misuse of money), rule of law, and transparency. Engage in public education (Friedman did a lot of that, demystifying money) so people understand and trust the framework. In crises, do whatever is necessary to uphold the core promises (protect deposits, backstop liquidity) to prevent a spiral of fear. As Carstens noted, trust is a precondition for effective policy Ôøº Ôøº ‚Äì in high-trust environments, even tough policies can succeed because the public cooperates (e.g. accepting short-term pain for long-term gain) Ôøº Ôøº.

By designing for quality, policymakers might avoid some pitfalls that focusing on quantity alone led to. For example, rather than announcing ‚Äúwe will grow M3 by 5%‚Äù, a central bank might say ‚Äúwe will ensure inflation stays around 2% and will be transparent in our operations and ready to adjust as needed‚Äù ‚Äì the latter speaks to quality targets (stability and adaptability) which arguably resonate more with the public‚Äôs interests (people ultimately care about stable prices and a reliable financial system, not the money aggregate per se).

A possible criticism of QMT is that it sounds abstract ‚Äì can we really measure ‚Äútrust‚Äù or ‚Äúcoherence‚Äù? While challenging, one can observe proxies: survey data on inflation expectations and trust in currency, market data like currency substitution (people switching to other currencies or gold indicates declining trust), etc. Over time, one could quantify improvements in monetary quality (for instance, after Volcker, long-term bond yields fell, indicating higher trust in the dollar‚Äôs future value). Another critique could be that QMT principles sometimes conflict ‚Äì e.g. being highly responsive (principle 3) could threaten coherence (principle 1) if policy becomes too erratic. This is a valid point: there are trade-offs to manage. A balance must be struck between flexibility and predictability. QMT doesn‚Äôt give a free pass to endless discretion; rather it calls for wise responsiveness ‚Äì perhaps rule-based flexibility, if such a term can be coined. In fact, modern ‚Äúflexible inflation targeting‚Äù embodies this: a clear rule (target) combined with some leeway on the timing of return to target, etc. QMT thus aligns with approaches that seek robust rules that yield desirable emergent behavior. It also appreciates the role of institutional culture: for trust, the integrity of those in charge matters (a point Friedman made often regarding the temptation for governments to exploit the printing press).

Conclusion

This paper has argued that the classic Quantity Theory of Money, while illuminating in its simplicity, provides an incomplete guide to monetary economics in a world of complex financial systems and human expectations. We presented a Quality of Money Theory (QMT) as a broader framework that accounts for the informational, institutional, and behavioral dimensions of money. By focusing on epistemic coherence, identity preservation, feedback responsiveness, and trust generation, QMT directs attention to how well money fulfills its roles, not just how much of it there is.

The review of critiques from both mainstream and heterodox sources showed that many ‚Äúpuzzles‚Äù and failures of monetarist policies were essentially failures of monetary quality: unstable velocity (information noise), endogenous credit booms (identity and trust issues in private monies), Cantillon effects (distributional signal distortion), and shadow banking crises (breakdown of trust and clarity in what constitutes money). These insights are not opposed to Friedman‚Äôs legacy, but rather enrich it. Milton Friedman emphasized stable rules and expectations ‚Äì implicitly, he understood that people‚Äôs confidence in money and policy is paramount. QMT builds on that by making such qualitative factors explicit. Meanwhile, Jeff Snider‚Äôs work reminds us that today‚Äôs monetary system is a bewildering ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù of global ledgers ‚Äì the quality of those ledgers (their reliability, transparency, support by lenders of last resort) is what determines whether the system hums or falters. In dedicating this framework to Friedman and Snider, we acknowledge Friedman‚Äôs foundational idea that money matters and Snider‚Äôs insistence that what we call ‚Äúmoney‚Äù has evolved and we must keep up.

Moving toward a high-quality monetary framework is both challenging and essential. It requires humility ‚Äì recognizing that controlling a few aggregates is not enough ‚Äì and creativity in institutional design. The payoff to improving monetary quality is large: a more stable price environment, fewer and milder crises, and greater public trust in institutions. These outcomes support healthier economic growth and allow money to do what it does best at its finest ‚Äì facilitate exchange and cooperation across time and space, as a stable signal of value.

Future research might operationalize QMT by developing indices of monetary quality and studying their correlation with macro outcomes. Policymakers could experiment with communication strategies and tools aimed explicitly at strengthening the four pillars (for example, publishing an annual ‚Äúfinancial trust report‚Äù analogous to an inflation report). Another avenue is international: applying QMT to the global monetary order. One might ask, what is the quality of the international dollar standard, and could it be improved (perhaps via multilateral reforms or new instruments) to reduce imbalances and crises? The euro crisis, too, can be seen as a test of monetary quality ‚Äì with structural issues in feedback and trust between member states coming to the fore. Addressing those required institutional changes (banking union, ECB backstop commitments) beyond just liquidity provision.

In conclusion, the Quality of Money Theory recasts our understanding of ‚Äúsound money.‚Äù It is not just about limiting quantity or tying money to a metal; it is about designing a system where money is informative, stable, adaptive, and trusted. Such money acts as a strong societal signal ‚Äì a facilitator of what Friedman called ‚Äúfree private markets‚Äù by providing a stable background against which they operate Ôøº. As we navigate the monetary challenges of the 21st century ‚Äì from digital currencies to unprecedented fiscal-monetary experiments ‚Äì keeping an eye on the quality of money may prove to be the key to unlocking sustained prosperity without the cycles of boom and bust that have so often plagued economies. In the spirit of Friedman, who combined theoretical boldness with pragmatic policy advice, and echoing Snider‚Äôs investigative rigor into the hidden realms of modern money, this framework encourages economists and policymakers to not only count money, but judge its character.

By developing a signal-based approach to monetary design, we aim for a future in which ‚Äúgood money‚Äù ‚Äì money that is coherent, reliable, responsive, and trustworthy ‚Äì underpins the global economy. Such money would truly deserve the public‚Äôs confidence, validating the insight that it is ultimately the quality, not merely the quantity, of money that sustains economic stability and progress.
